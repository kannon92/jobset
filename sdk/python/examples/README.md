# Using the Python SDK

# Installation

Easiest way to get started is to create a virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv jobset-test
source jobset-test/bin/active
python3 -m pip install sdk/python/.
```

This will install the jobset package into your virtual environment.

See create_jobset.py for some examples of using the models.
