## Jobset

A JobSet creates one or more Jobs. It allows you to create sets of jobs of different or identical templates, and control their lifecycle together.

## Running an Example JobSet

Here is an example JobSet. It runs a distributed PyTorch training workload.

```yaml
apiVersion: jobset.x-k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: JobSet
metadata:
  name: pytorch
spec:
  replicatedJobs:
    - name: workers
      template:
        spec:
          parallelism: 4
          completions: 4
          backoffLimit: 0
          template:
           spec:
            containers:
            - name: pytorch
              image: gcr.io/k8s-staging-jobset/pytorch-resnet:latest
              ports:
              - containerPort: 3389
              env:
              - name: MASTER_ADDR
                value: "pytorch-workers-0-0.pytorch"
              - name: MASTER_PORT
                value: "3389"
              command:
              - bash
              - -xc
              - |
                torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 --master_addr=$MASTER_ADDR --master_port=$MASTER_PORT resnet.py --backend=gloo
```

To list all the jobs that belong to a JobSet, you can use a command like this:

```shell
kubectl get jobs --selector=jobset.sigs.k8s.io/jobset-name=pytorch
```

The output is similar to 

```
NAME                COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
pytorch-workers-0   0/4           6m12s      6m12s
```

To list all the pods that belong to a JobSet, you can use a command like this:

```shell
kubectl get pods --selector=jobset.sigs.k8s.io/jobset-name=pytorch
```

The output is similar to 

```
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pytorch-workers-0-0-tcngx   1/1     Running   0          13m
pytorch-workers-0-1-sbhxs   1/1     Running   0          13m
pytorch-workers-0-2-5m6d6   1/1     Running   0          13m
pytorch-workers-0-3-mn8c8   1/1     Running   0          13m
```

## JobSet defaults for Jobs and Pods

- Job [`completionMode`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#completion-mode) is defaulted to `Indexed` 
- Pod [`restartPolicy`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#pod-template) is defaulted to `OnFailure`


## JobSet labels

JobSet labels will have `jobset.x-k8s.io/` prefix. JobSet sets the following labels on both the jobs and pods:
- `jobset.sigs.k8s.io/jobset-name`: `.metadata.name`
- `jobset.sigs.k8s.io/replicatedjob-name`: `.spec.replicatedJobs[*].name`
- `jobset.sigs.k8s.io/replicatedjob-replicas`: `.spec.replicatedJobs[*].replicas`
- `jobset.sigs.k8s.io/job-index`: ordinal index of a job within a `spec.replicatedJobs[*]`


## ReplicatedJob

The list `.spec.replicatedJobs` allows the user to define groups of Jobs of different templates.

Each entry of `.spec.replicatedJobs` defines a Job template in `spec.replicatedJobs[*].template`, 
and the number replicas that should be created in `spec.replicatedJobs[*].replicas`. When 
unset, it is defaulted to 1.

Each Job in each `spec.replicatedJobs` gets a different job-index in the range 0 to `.spec.replicatedJob[*].replicas-1`. 
The Job name will have the following format: `<jobSetName>-<replicatedJobName>-<jobIndex>`. 


### DNS hostnames for Pods

By default, JobSet configures DNS for Pods by creating a headless service for each `spec.replicatedJobs`. 
The headless service name, which determines the subdomain, is `.metadata.name-.spec.replicatedJobs[*].name`

To list all the headless services that belong to a JobSet, you can use a command like this:

```shell
kubectl get services --selector=jobset.sigs.k8s.io/jobset-name=pytorch
```

The output is similar to 

```
NAME              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
pytorch-workers   ClusterIP   None         <none>        <none>    25m
```

### Exclusive Job to topology placement

The JobSet annotation `alpha.jobset.sigs.k8s.io/exclusive-topology` defines 1:1 job to topology placement. 
For example, consider the case where the nodes are assigned a rack label. To optimize for network
performance, we want to assign each job exclusively to one rack. This can be done as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: jobset.x-k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: JobSet
metadata:
  name: pytorch
  annotations:
    alpha.jobset.sigs.k8s.io/exclusive-topology: rack
spec:
  replicatedJobs:
    - name: workers
      template:
        spec:
          ...
```

## JobSet termination

A JobSet is marked as successful when ALL the Jobs it created completes successfully. 

A JobSet failure is counted when ANY of its child Jobs fail. `spec.failurePolicy.maxRestarts` defines how many times  
to automatically restart the JobSet. A restart is done by recreating all child jobs.

A JobSet is terminally failed when the number of failures reaches `spec.failurePolicy.maxRestarts`

## Elastic JobSets

JobSets have the ability to upscale or downscale after the job is created.

JobSet supports this feature by allowing mutable changes for the replicas of a JobSet.

One can increase or decrease the replicas of a ReplicatedJob.
Templates and Names of replicate jobs are not allowed to change during updates.
